# `1. ReactJs Setup`

I have setup this boilerplate code using Node Version: `16.13.0` (includes npm `8.1.0`) & React: `17.0.2`<br/>

### [üìù] Have ReactJs in your System

1. Install Nodejs
   - You can have the Node LTS and configure it from [Nodejs.org](https://reactjs.org/en/download/)<br/>
     üîó [**Read More: Getting Started With NodeJS**](https://medium.com/@erickcodes/getting-started-with-node-js-84972881508b)
2. npm install -g create-react-app
3. npx create-react-app appName
4. cd appName ---> code .
5. npm start (to run)

## `2. Setup The Project`

- You can clone this repo from command line using `git clone ${repo_url}`.

- Run `npm install | yarn`
- Create an `.env` file and add your configuration as per your need similar to reference file `.env.example`
- You can add your base url for API's and apis endpoints in `/src/redux/apiEndPoints.ts`
- Run `npm start | yarn start` -> to start the app.

## `3. Folder Structure`

- `build` -> Our build for production will be bundlled in this folder on running `yarn build | npm run build`.
- `Public` -> Our base file root index.js and all other resources like logo is there.
- `webpack` ->
  - `webpack.common.js` -> Common webpack configuration's rule to be applied.
  - `webpack.dev.js` -> Development webpack configuration's rule to be applied.
  - `webpack.prod.js` -> Production webpack configuration's rule to be applied.
  - `webpack.config.js` -> Merging the common webpack rules with webpack file according to env -> For `yarn start -- dev` && `yarn build -- prod`.
- `src` -> Folder where your whole client configuration and other things will come.
  - `index.tsx` -> This is the main file which start's your client (App Entry Point).
  - `App.tsx` -> File where all our components are configured wrapped with persisted store and fallback spinner.
  - `App.css` -> Base CSS file.
  - `assets` -> Folder where all our CSS, Images, or Javascript files will come.It will containts all the external resources to be included.
  - `components` -> Components that can be reused with props will be defined here.
  - `helpers` -> Common types which can be used in many places can be defined here.

  - `router` -> All our routes will come in this folder with roles management.
  - `utils` -> All our constants and general utilities function which are frequently needed can be defined here.
  - `redux` -> All our API bussiness logics and store setup will be in this folder.
    - `actions` -> All our redux-actions will be defined here according to each module.
    - `reducers` -> All our reducers to catch actions will be defined and then combined in the rootReducer.
    - `store.ts` -> Store configuration with persisted storage.
    - `api.ts` -> Base axios configuration with Request & Response interceptors.
    - `apiEndPoints.ts` -> All our end-points are defined in this file.
  - `views` -> All our components and bussines logics according to modules that needs to be rendered are here.
- `.history.ts` -> Configuring the browser history.
- `.babelrc` -> Babel config file.
- `.prettierrc.js` -> Rules for code formatting using prettier.
- `.eslintrc.js` -> Eslint rules to be check throughout the code.
- `.env` -> All our environment variables.
- `.env.example` -> Reference file for `.env`.
