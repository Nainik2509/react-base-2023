# `1. ReactJs Setup`

I have setup this boilerplate code using Node Version: `16.13.0` (includes npm `8.1.0`) & React: `17.0.2`<br/>

### [📝] Have ReactJs in your System

1. Install Nodejs
   - You can have the Node LTS and configure it from [Nodejs.org](https://reactjs.org/en/download/)<br/>
     🔗 [**Read More: Getting Started With NodeJS**](https://medium.com/@erickcodes/getting-started-with-node-js-84972881508b)
2. npm install -g create-react-app
3. npx create-react-app appName
4. cd appName ---> code .
5. npm start (to run)

## `2. Setup The Project`

- You can clone this repo from command line using `git clone ${repo_url}`.

- Run `npm install | yarn`
- Create an `.env` file and add your configuration as per your need similar to reference file `.env.example`
- You can add your base url for API's and apis endpoints in `/src/redux/apiEndPoints.ts`
- Run `npm start | yarn start` -> to start the app.

## `3. Folder Structure`

- `build` -> Our build for production will be bundlled in this folder on running `yarn build | npm run build`.

- `webpack` ->
  - `webpack.common.js` -> Common webpack configuration's rule to be applied.
  - `webpack.dev.js` -> Development webpack configuration's rule to be applied.
  - `webpack.prod.js` -> Production webpack configuration's rule to be applied.
  - `webpack.config.js` -> Merging the common webpack rules with webpack file according to env -> For `yarn start -- dev` && `yarn build -- prod`.
- `src` -> Folder where your whole client configuration and other things will come.
